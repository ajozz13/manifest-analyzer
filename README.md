IBC Air AMS Test Suite
======================

Introduction
------------

This project is intended for IBC customers and developers seeking to
test their Air AMS import manifests for use with the IBC Air AMS system.

The format of the manifest file is fully documented in this link:
http://www.pactrak.com/manifest-to-pactrak.html

The Project is written in Ruby, and it is the same testing framework 
currently used at IBC for the manifest testing submission tool.

Please keep in mind, that a successful test from this tool, makes it 
likely that your file submissions will be accepted by the standar 
IBC Air AMS system.  Please use this software at your own convenience and note
that we make no warranties whatsoever as of the acceptance of your submitted
manifests, as they will be retested on your regular standard submissions.
